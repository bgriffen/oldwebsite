Hi. I’m Brendan, a computational astrophysicist by training with core interests in biology, engineering and computer science based in San Francisco, California. 

I’m currently CTO and co-founder of Scaled Biolabs, a data driven, full-stack biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing next generation cell therapies. I'm currently CTO and co-founder of [Scaled Biolabs](https://www.scaledbiolabs.com/), a data driven, full-stack biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing next generation cell therapies. 

I have a number of other professional affiliations including being Project Leader of [The Caterpillar Project](https://www.caterpillarproject.org/), a large computational galaxy formation project at MIT. I am also a project collaborator on the [Illustris Project](http://www.illustris-project.org/) at Harvard. You can find a few of my musings in these areas on my project page or throughout my semi-active blog.
